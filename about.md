I began at UNT as a classical performance major playing trombone before transitioning to mathematics and economics. I completed my Ph.D. in Mathematics in 2023, studying representations of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and superalgebras. I now work as a backend engineer, developing data infrastructure for AI-powered business intelligence.

## Personal Interests

### Gaming

I play video games across various genres. Strategy games and RPGs take up most of my gaming time, though I appreciate well-crafted games of any type.

### Early Work Experience

During my undergraduate years, I worked as a bouncer at a bar in Denton and as a teaching assistant for mathematics courses. The bouncer work taught me to read situations quickly and handle conflict calmly. The teaching assistant position confirmed my interest in mathematics education and led to my graduate teaching work.

### Powerlifting

I competed in powerlifting from 2015 to 2019 in the USAPL. My best competition total was 1648 lbs (617 lb squat, 397 lb bench, 634 lb deadlift) at 262 lbs bodyweight. I competed at several regional and national meets, including USAPL Collegiate Nationals. My full competition history is available on [OpenPowerlifting](https://www.openpowerlifting.org/u/williamgoode).

### Cycling and Yoga

I now focus on cycling and yoga rather than powerlifting. I ride regularly and find that cycling provides both physical exercise and mental clarity. Yoga complements this by improving flexibility and body awareness, which I lost during years of heavy lifting.

### Hiking

I enjoy hiking when I can. I climbed Mt. Fuji in 2024, reaching the summit at sunrise. The climb itself was straightforward, but the altitude and cold were challenging.
