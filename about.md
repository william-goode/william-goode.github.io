I began at UNT as a classical performance major playing trombone before transitioning to mathematics and economics. I completed my Ph.D. in Mathematics in 2023, studying representations of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and superalgebras. I now work as a backend engineer, developing data infrastructure for AI-powered business intelligence.

During my undergraduate years, I worked as a bouncer at the Fry Street Tavern in Denton, and as a tutor and undergraduate teaching assistant for mathematics courses.

I competed in powerlifting from 2015 to 2019 in the USAPL. My best competition total was 1648 lbs (617 lb squat, 397 lb bench, 634 lb deadlift) at 262 lbs bodyweight. I competed at several regional and national meets, including USAPL Collegiate Nationals. My full competition history is available on [OpenPowerlifting](https://www.openpowerlifting.org/u/williamgoode).

These days, I mostly stick to cycling and yoga. Below is my 2020 Trek Domane ALR 4, which I regularly abuse.

I hike when I can. I climbed most of Mt. Fuji in 2024. We were turned away near the summit due to weather, but I managed to get a pretty good shot before the clouds closed up on us again.

I still play quite a lot of video games. Some of my favorites:

* Factorio
* 1000xRESIST
* Baldur's Gate
* Outer Wilds
* World of Warcraft
* SIGNALIS
* Hollow Knight
* Dark Souls
* Total War: WARHAMMER
* Subnautica
* Dota 2
* Hades
