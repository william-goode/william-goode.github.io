## Research

My research focuses on representations of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and superalgebras of vector fields. I develop methods for describing annihilators of modules under conditions that arise in tensor modules of vector field Lie algebras.

**Publications:**
- C. H. Conley, W. Goode. "An approach to annihilators in the context of vector field Lie algebras." *Expositiones Mathematicae* (2024). [arXiv:2403.01728](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01728)

**Presentations:**
- Joint Mathematics Meeting, Boston (2023)
- Graduate Algebra Symposium, UT Arlington (2022)
- Southwest Local Algebra Meeting, Baylor University (2022)
- University of North Texas Algebra Seminar (2021-2022)
