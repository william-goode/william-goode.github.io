---

## In Progress

_None currently_

---

## Issues / Blockers

### 1. Resume Generation Not Automated ⚠️

**Issue**: Resume PDF must be manually regenerated when content changes.

**Impact**: 
- Risk of outdated resume if content changes but script isn't run
- No automatic updates when CV data (`_data/cv.yml`) changes
- Requires manual step in workflow

**Status**: Identified for automation

---

## Next Steps / To-Dos

### Priority 1: Feature Segmentation

**Goal**: Segment journal entries by features/projects rather than purely chronological.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Analyze current journal structure and identify feature groupings
- [ ] Design feature-based organization system
- [ ] Create feature tags/categories for entries
- [ ] Reorganize existing entries with feature segmentation
- [ ] Update journal format to support both chronological and feature-based views
- [ ] Document feature segmentation approach

**Benefits**:
- Easier to track progress on specific features/projects
- Better visibility into feature development lifecycle
- More useful for portfolio presentation
- Enables feature-based filtering and organization

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours

---

### Priority 2: Automated Resume Building on Commit

**Goal**: Automatically regenerate resume PDF when relevant files change.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add Python dependencies to GitHub Actions workflow (reportlab)
- [ ] Create resume generation step in `.github/workflows/jekyll.yml`
- [ ] Configure workflow to run `generate_resume.py` on commits
- [ ] Ensure generated PDF is included in Jekyll build output
- [ ] Test automated generation in GitHub Actions
- [ ] Document resume generation process

**Implementation Options**:
1. **GitHub Actions**: Add step to existing workflow
   - Install Python dependencies
   - Run `generate_resume.py`
   - Commit generated PDF (if changed)
   
2. **Pre-commit Hook**: Local automation
   - Git hook runs script before commit
   - Ensures PDF is always up-to-date locally

3. **Hybrid**: Both local hook and CI/CD
   - Pre-commit hook for local development
   - GitHub Actions for CI/CD verification

**Files to Modify**:
- `.github/workflows/jekyll.yml` - Add resume generation step
- `package.json` - Potentially add npm script wrapper
- `.gitignore` - Ensure PDF is tracked (if not already)

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 hours

---

### Priority 3: Feature Segmentation in Resume/Website

**Goal**: Include feature-based organization in resume and website presentation.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Design feature-based resume sections
- [ ] Update `generate_resume.py` to support feature grouping
- [ ] Create feature-based CV view on website
- [ ] Add feature filtering to CV timeline component
- [ ] Update `_data/cv.yml` structure to include feature tags
- [ ] Implement feature-based navigation/filtering on website
- [ ] Test feature segmentation across all views

**Implementation Details**:

**Resume Updates**:
- Group experience items by feature/project
- Add feature tags or sections
- Maintain chronological ordering within features
- Highlight feature-specific achievements

**Website Updates**:
- Enhance CV timeline component with feature filtering
- Add feature tags to experience entries
- Create feature-based view option
- Update CV page to support feature filtering

**Data Structure**:
- Extend `_data/cv.yml` with feature metadata
- Add feature tags to experience entries
- Maintain backward compatibility

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 hours

## Technical Decisions

### 1. Progress Report Format

**Decision**: Follow format from ScaylorAI repositories.

**Rationale**:
- Consistent with existing work tracking
- Familiar structure
- Comprehensive documentation approach

### 2. Resume Automation Approach

**Decision**: Implement GitHub Actions automation first, consider pre-commit hook later.

**Rationale**:
- Ensures CI/CD consistency
- No local setup required
- Can add pre-commit hook for faster local feedback later

### 3. Feature Segmentation Strategy

**Decision**: Implement feature tags/categories while maintaining chronological structure.

**Rationale**:
- Preserves existing chronological organization
- Adds new organizational dimension
- Enables multiple views (chronological, feature-based, hybrid)

---

## Notes

- Current journal format works well for chronological tracking
- Feature segmentation will enhance portfolio presentation
- Resume automation reduces maintenance burden
- Feature-based organization improves clarity of work history
- All changes should maintain backward compatibility

---

## Questions to Answer

1. What features/projects should be identified for segmentation?
2. Should feature segmentation be optional or required?
3. How granular should feature tags be?
4. Should resume maintain strict chronological order or prioritize features?
5. How to handle entries that span multiple features?

   - Identify feature categories
   - Design tagging system
   - Plan migration approach

2. **Implement automated resume building** 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY
