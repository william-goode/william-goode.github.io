abstract = {We present a general method for describing the annihilators of modules of Lie algebras under certain conditions, which hold for some tensor modules of vector field Lie algebras. As an example, we apply the method to obtain an efficient proof of previously known results on the annihilators of the bounded irreducible modules of VecR.}
