We describe annihilators of tensor density modules (TDMs) of contact vector fields. $\mathcal{K}$ is the Lie superalgebra of contact polynomial vector fields on the superline. It comes with a natural action on the space , where  is a symbol with the property that . The TDMs of  are a 1-parameter family of deformations of this action.  has a maximal conformal subalgebra isomorphic to . Relevant to our discussion will be the Casimir operator of  and its square root, often referred to as “Casimir’s ghost". We will give generators for the annihilating ideals in the universal enveloping algebra  of the TDMs. We further describe the generator for the intersection of these annihilating ideals: the annihilator of the direct sum of the TDMs.
